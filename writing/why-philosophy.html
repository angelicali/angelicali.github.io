        <p>After my B.S. in Computer Science, I was a software engineer at Google for 2.5 years until I quit my job to study philosophy instead. Now, having obtained my M.A in philosophy, I'm returning to tech. Throughout my job search, I was often questioned: Why did I leave? And why am I returning now?</p>
        <p>Before I try to answer, I need to disclaim that I did not have the answers immediately. I scratched my head trying to figure out the true reasons I made these decisions. I dug into my past but the past did not yield itself easily. The reasons, desires, and motivations surface in pieces, and sometimes conflictory; they never appear in a linear fashion which would give a nice narrative. The explanations below are what I today feel truest out of all the narratives that had come to me.</p>
        <p>It was 2019; the good job market gave me the impression that landing a job is easy. I had multiple big tech offers and was able to negotiate for a higher compensation. After having secured myself a job and before starting my employment, I indulged myself in an enthusiastic exploration of things that I deemed interesting but of no productive use for my career. (I long had the habit of diligently depriving myself of things that are "nonproductive".) Among these things is philosophy. It was my very first contact with philosophy, and I was mesmerized. I was invited, for example, to wrap my head around the notion of free will in light of the (almost) deterministic motion of the physical world, to recognize that the possibility of us indeed living in a Matrix can't be entirely ruled out, to work out a personal reconciliation with the seeming insignificance of all our pursuits in this vast universe. This last one made a strong impression on me, but I soon forgot about it as my post-graduation Europe trip and later my new life at Google occupied me.</p>
        <p>After I settled in in my new job, I picked up philosophy in my spare time. Specifically, I continued that last line of philosophical pursuit. We are deeply invested in our goals, projects, relationships, values. We take life seriously, as if our pursuits have unquestionable importance. But if we step back and take a detached perspective, we recognize that our lives are a tiny speck of the vast universe, and the meaning we have ascribed to our activities seems trivial. How are we to reconcile the seriousness with which we take our lives and the insignificance of human efforts to the universe?</p>
        <p>After a while, I came to the perspective that it is a very fortunate thing that the particles that make up me have formed me - a biological organism that is capable of experiencing the world and acting in this world - instead of roaming in the vacuum of outer space, which are the condition of most particles. It is exactly the expansiveness of universe that makes every instance of living a fortunate event. I felt grateful, and decided that I must make good use of this chance to experience a human life. I started to examine my situation. Immediately I felt embarrassed that I had, prior to my exposure to philosophy, never thought much about where I was heading. The direction had always been clear, and I never questioned it. In high school it was important that I get into a highly-ranked college. In college it was important that I land a prestigious job. (How does one come to pursue prestige mindlessly? An interesting subject for another day.) Now that I was convicted to live my life intentionally, I would have the steering wheel back into my hands, I thought.</p>
        <p>During those days I would go on long walks in the woods to think about such matters. If I continue my current path, I would be climbing the corporate ladder, but I had no interest in climbing the ladder for its own sake. We talk about one's career as a given, but do we really need it? What are alternative ways of life? Is it possible to not work at all? Given the vast amount of options life has afforded me, how am I to choose? What matters for me, in life?</p>
        <p>My conviction to live my life intentionally gave me the courage to change, but I couldn't figure out what I want and therefore didn't know where to apply my courage. It wasn't because I didn't have any interest, but because desires seem to me engineer-able. I can get myself into a state of mind in which I feel excited by the entrepreneurship by reading stories and books about startups. I can also tune into a hunger for knowledge: when I see someone speaking fluently about economics, about history, about politics, I want to be like them. I had also fell in love with literature, with the beauty and power of words. In other words, I can come to desire anything; I just need to put myself in the corresponding environment. Something can appear very worth pursuing to me at a particular moment, but at the back of my mind I know that I can come to be equally excited about a different thing. So I couldn't make up my mind.</p>
        <p>Eventually, I decided that studying philosophy is a reasonable next step. I was uncertain whether philosophy would help me figure out what to do with my life, but I thought at the very least it can be a critical thinking bootcamp. (I felt critical thinking was a skill I desperately needed.) Plus, if I were to take any risk in life, the best time to risk it was now, when I was still unmarried and childless. So I took the leap; I applied to MA programs in philosophy and, after I got admissions, I told my manager that I plan to quit.</p>
        <p>Over the two and half years when my previous world (of tech) seemed far away, I gradually came to the conclusion that I want a career. My coursework exposed me to a wide variety of subjects: ethics, meta-ethics, epistemology (study of knowledge), philosophy of science, political philosophy. But each time I felt a restless dissatisfaction in me wanting to go deeper; a semester-long course only scratches the surface of things. It then struck me that <i>depth</i> is where the most interesting things lie. It does not matter much which field I choose, what's important is that I go deep into it and think about it. Any subject can be the material for me to philosophize on. (Depth is important because otherwise life would be boring to me. I had also considered the tranquil life which doesn't require depth into anything; but after having experienced the thrill from clarity and depth I feel unable to settle for mere tranquility without depth.)</p>
        <p>That was a big milestone for me, knowing that depth is what I wanted and that choosing <i>a</i> direction is more important than choosing the "best" direction. The rest of the decision (to return to tech) came easy. Among all things I have knowledge of, computer science (and specifically software engineering) is where I have the strongest foundation. Plus, it'll give me financial stability (and thereby peace of mind). I see no reason to, say, pursue a more difficult path (e.g. a career in academic philosophy) when I would equally enjoy an easier path. So I will return and deepen my expertise in whatever I end up doing.</p>
        <p>It might sound like I took a long winded road only to end up at where I started. But (in addition to the subjects I learned along the way) this journey was necessary. It wasn't enough that society or parents or peers tell me a career in software engineering is a good choice. I had to decide for myself, both that I wanted a career at all and that I wanted a career in software engineering. And I could not have decided that without having explored sufficient breadth to realize the importance of depth.</p>
