        <h3>Staying in the present?</h3>
        <small>2024/06/24</small>
        <p class="first-paragraph">
            It's trendy nowadays to say that you gotta stay in the present. Staying in the present seems to be a
            solution to many problems. But what exactly does it mean to stay in the present? The first definition I came
            up with is to stay fully aware of all the senses we're experiencing at the moment. e.g. what we see, hear,
            smell; the person or event in front of us. Our attention can be given to our senses or to our thoughts and
            imaginations. Maybe "staying in the present" means to direct our
            attention to things that are happening in the present moment. But then I didn't know how to categorize
            thoughts - thoughts about the <em>present</em> election, thoughts about the <em>present</em> warfare in
            Israel. There surely is an understanding of "staying in the present" that allows these thoughts. If not,
            "staying in the present" is not the absolute imperative that applies on all occasions. (It could be the
            prescription for someone who ruminates on something in the past.) So the next idea I settled on is "living
            intentionally". Thinking, about present or past or future things, should be acceptable if done
            intentionally, vs mindlessly. This is an idea I try to live by. Eating without multitasking.

            That said, this idea still seems to have a minor exception. Is there intention when we enter the state of
            flow? It seems to me that even the intention is pushed out of our mind, because the entirety of our mind is
            devoted to the activity itself. Flow is good, and flow doesn't involve intention; so should we conclude that
            "living intentionally" is not an imperative we can apply all the time? Well I'd rather reject the premise
            that "flow is good", at least for my conception of a good life. One can enter flow from a mindless
            desire-following (e.g. an urge to play video games). I think it's better to enter video game playihng from a conscious chocie.

            Another exception, which didn't occur to me until the time of writing, is that serial killers can be
            living intentionally too. They may be fully committed to the intention of killing. Living intentionally
            might be necessary for (my idea of) good life, but it isn't sufficient. So I would add the extra ingredient
            of reflection. We need to live intentionally, while periodically reflecting on our intentions. Still, the
            serial killers might be committed to their mission even after such reflection, but I hope this formula is
            good enough for most cases.
